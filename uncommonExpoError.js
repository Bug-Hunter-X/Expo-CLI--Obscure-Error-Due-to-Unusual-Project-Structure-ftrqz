This error occurs when using Expo CLI with a project that has an unusual or unexpected file structure, or when there's a conflict between the project's configuration and the Expo CLI's expectations.  It's often related to misconfigured or missing files like `app.json`, `package.json`, or `babel.config.js`.  The error message itself is usually quite generic and doesn't pinpoint the exact cause.
