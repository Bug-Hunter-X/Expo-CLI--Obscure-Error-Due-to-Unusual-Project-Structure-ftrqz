The solution involves meticulously checking the project's `app.json`, `package.json`, and `babel.config.js` files for any syntax errors, missing fields, or inconsistencies with the Expo CLI's expectations. If the problem persists, try simplifying the project's directory structure and eliminating unnecessary files.  Reinstalling Expo CLI (`npm install -g expo-cli`) may also be helpful in some cases.  Sometimes, a completely fresh project setup is needed to bypass some deep-seated configuration issues.
