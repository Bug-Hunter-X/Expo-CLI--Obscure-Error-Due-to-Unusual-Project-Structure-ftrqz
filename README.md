# Expo CLI: Obscure Error Due to Unusual Project Structure

This repository demonstrates an uncommon error encountered when using the Expo CLI. The error arises from an unexpected project file structure or a configuration conflict that leads to a generic and unhelpful error message from the Expo CLI.

## Problem
The Expo CLI fails to build or start the project due to a configuration issue or unusual file arrangement. The error message is often not specific enough to diagnose the root cause.

## Solution
The solution involves careful examination of the project's configuration files (`app.json`, `package.json`, `babel.config.js`, etc.), ensuring that they adhere to Expo's requirements.  Sometimes, restructuring the project's directories can also resolve the issue. The solution file showcases a corrected project structure and configuration.
